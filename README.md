# ChillBill: Personal Receipt & Expense Manager

## Description

ChillBill is a personal accounting application designed to help individuals and groups manage digital receipts, split expenses, detect recurring subscriptions, and generate meaningful spending insights. By providing a centralized dashboard, automated reminders, and advanced analytics, ChillBill simplifies personal and group financial management.

### Key Features
- **Receipt Management**: Upload, store, and categorize receipts using OCR technology (Tesseract or Google Vision API).
- **Expense Splitting**: Create groups for splitting expenses among friends, family, or housemates.
- **Financial Insights**: Track spending trends, category breakdowns, and predictive insights.
- **Subscription Detection**: Identify recurring subscriptions and send reminders before renewal.
- **Notifications**: Alerts for due payments, subscription renewals, overspending, and group expense updates.
- **Security**: AES-256 encryption and protection against XSS, CSRF, SQL injection, and other vulnerabilities.

## Motivation

### Primary Problems to Solve
1. **Disorganized Receipts**: Traditional paper receipts are often lost or damaged. ChillBill digitizes receipts and extracts relevant data automatically.
2. **Painful Expense Splitting**: Manually splitting bills among multiple people leads to confusion and errors. ChillBill automates cost-sharing with a clear dashboard.
3. **Recurring Subscriptions**: Many users forget about recurring charges until they see an unexpected bank statement. ChillBill detects subscriptions and sends timely reminders.
4. **Financial Visibility**: Most people lack a holistic view of their spending patterns. ChillBill aggregates receipts and bank transactions to provide actionable insights.
5. **Security & Trust**: Users need confidence that their financial data is safe. ChillBill uses AES-256 encryption and robust security measures.

### Why ChillBill?
- **Paperless Organization**: Store all receipts digitally in one place.
- **Time Savings**: Automated OCR and bank integrations reduce manual data entry.
- **Transparency in Group Expenses**: Automatically calculate each person’s share.
- **Subscription Oversight**: Detect recurring fees and get reminders for renewals.
- **Actionable Insights**: Clear visualizations help users make better financial decisions.
- **Security & Privacy**: AES-256 encryption and secure best practices ensure data safety.
